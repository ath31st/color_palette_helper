1. accepts a hex code and generates a colored rectangle with the name of the color

2. generates the following color palettes based on the resulting hex code:
   - Complementary color palettes are formed by using two colors on opposite sides of the color wheel. They are great for conveying a sense of balance.

   - Monochromatic color schemes consist of different shades and depths of the same color. In such schemes, all colors are derived from a single color.

   - Analogous are created by pairing one color with two others on either side of it on the color wheel. These palettes express uniformity and consistency.

If you want to use a bot with your token, run it with the parameters (bot_name bot_token).

I didn't rent a server for a bot, but just used raspberries. This is my little production server from improvised means.
